The laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks, to be paid for by the gun purchaser, among other restrictions. Morse thanked his constituents for the chance to serve them and said \"the Democratic Party will continue to fight.\" Morse, a Colorado Springs lawmaker whose support was vital to enactment of the legislation, called the restrictions a measured, common-sense response to gun violence in a state with a long, venerated tradition of gun ownership. The laws, which took effect July 1, remain in force despite Tuesday\\'s vote. He repeatedly said that even if he lost his job, passing the gun measures was worth the sacrifice.\\'. The explanation sentence should clarify the target_phrase=\\'called the restrictions a measured, common-sense response to gun violence\\'.\\n### Assistant:'"

The nature of perilous currents seems straightforward: Water piles up between the beach and an offshore sandbar, then finds a low point in the bar and rushes back out to sea, sometimes carrying hapless swimmers with it. Of course, the handful of cases that would shoot swimmers straight out and not return them could be fatal for weak swimmers. Again and again the researchers toted 3-foot yellow-and-green contraptions fashioned from foam, plastic sewer pipe, gym weights and cheap GPS units into the surf, then walked along the beach to wherever the odd devices washed up and retrieved them under the gaze of puzzled sunbathers.

Conservationists are temporarily renting 14,000 acres from rice farmers and flooding them just long enough to give the migrating birds the rest and food they need to survive their flights.
