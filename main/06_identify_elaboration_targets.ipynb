New Haven has pledged to have all students reading proficiently by the end of third grade, putting them on track for college readiness by high school. The Promise program will be considered a success if students are able to do well enough in college to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree. Educators are tracking students who enter college on a Promise scholarship and finding that many do not enroll for a second year after finishing the first. Many are unable to keep up the minimum grade average. The ability to not just start college, but stay with it is called \"college persistence.\" Middle-class students on the Promise Scholarships tend to do better than their lower-income peers. That goes to show that there are big barriers to achieving success, even when there is money pointed at the problem. For example, in Kalamazoo, the success rate for middle-income students was about twice that for poor students, with the low-income students either losing their scholarships or being put on probation.\\' that need clarification.
